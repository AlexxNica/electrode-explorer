        <li>Use when you want the benefits of a normal sidebar menu, but do not have the space to list all options.</li>
        <li>Use when there are more than 2 main sections on a website each with 2 or more subsections.</li>
        <li>Use when you have less than 10 main sections</li>
        <li>Use when you only have two levels to show in the main navigation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Specifications (from UX)</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Each headline / section has a panel, which upon clicking can be expanded either vertically or horizontally into showing its subsections.</li>
        <li>The transition from showing no options of a headline to showing a headlineâ€™s list of options can be done either with a page refresh or with a javascript DHTML animation.</li>
        <li>When one panel is clicked it is expanded, while other panels are collapsed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
