==================

## Introduction

> Before getting started, please make sure you read the [React Developer Guide](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/react/react-dev-guide)!

> If you want to use `builder` as a CLI tool (recommended), follow the instructions at [formidablelabs/builder to modify your `PATH`](https://github.com/formidablelabs/builder#local-install)

## Component Documentation

Complete component documentation can be found [Here](components.md)

## The Generator

Is on the way. Will be part of a future version.

## Developing

- Installing dependencies: `npm install`
- Running a demo: `builder run demo` (then navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`)
- Running unit tests: `builder run test` (this run's the lint task first)
- To regenerate documentation: `builder run generate`. Note: If you run `builder run demo` it also runs this script for you.

## Quick Start

Run `builder run demo` from the terminal and visit [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/) to see some electrode goodness.

## CSS Conventions

When writing component specific css, please follow these [naming conventions](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md#components). We prefix all of our product
specific css selectors with a `prod-` name space, for e.g. the style class for Offer section could be `prod-ProductOffer`.
