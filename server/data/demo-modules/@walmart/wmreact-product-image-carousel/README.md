## Developing

- Installing dependencies: `npm install`
- Running a demo: `builder run demo` (then navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`)
- Running unit tests: `builder run test` (this run's the lint task first)
- To regenerate documentation: `builder run generate`. Note: If you run `builder run demo` it also runs this script for you.

## Common Workflow
- Pull latest `master`
- Create a new branch off `master`
- Add your UI component along with your unit tests
- Run `builder run demo` this generates demo and documentation. Never edit anything in the demo folder, all of its content is autogenerated.
- Ensure your component works as expected by visiting the demo page
- Run `builder run test` and ensure it passes. This will lint your js code and runt unit tests.
- Commit and open a PR against master
- Wait for ci build to pass, address any review comments as needed.
- Merge your PR
- And finally publish using these [guidelines](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/react/react-dev-guide#version-bumping-and-publishing)

specific css selectors with a `prod-` name space, for e.g. the style class for Offer section could be `prod-ProductOffer`.
