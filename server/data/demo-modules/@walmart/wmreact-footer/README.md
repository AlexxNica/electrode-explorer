==================

A set of react components used to display Footer

> Before getting started, please make sure you read the [React Developer Guide](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/react/react-dev-guide)!

## Component Documentation
Complete component documentation can be found [Here](components.md)

## Developing
If you want to use `builder` as a CLI tool (recommended), follow the instructions at [formidablelabs/builder to modify your `PATH`](https://github.com/formidablelabs/builder#local-install)

- Installing dependencies: `npm install`
- Running a demo: `builder run demo` (then navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`)
- Running unit tests: `builder run test` (this run's the lint task first)

## Installation

```
npm install @walmart/wmreact-footer
```

## Polyfills

- Promise (`core-js/fn/promise` - needed by `tempo-core`)

## Common Workflow
- Pull latest `master`
- Create a new branch off `master`
- Add your UI component along with your unit tests
- Run `builder run demo` this generates demo and documentation. Never edit anything in the demo folder, all of its content is autogenerated.
- Ensure your component works as expected by visiting the demo page
- Run `builder run test` and ensure it passes. This will lint your js code and runt unit tests.
- Commit and open a PR against master
- Wait for ci build to pass, address any review comments as needed.
- Merge your PR
- And finally publish using these [guidelines](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/react/react-dev-guide#version-bumping-and-publishing)

## Quick Start

Run `builder run demo` from the terminal and visit [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/) to see some electrode goodness.
To view the demo with hot reload enabled, navigate to `http://localhost:4000/webpack-dev-server/`

## Publishing

For publishing your component to npm, see the [Version Bumping and Publishing Guide](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/react/react-dev-guide#version-bumping-and-publishing)

## CSS Conventions

When writing component specific css, please follow these [naming conventions](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md#components). We prefix all of our footer
specific css selectors with a `footer-` name space, for e.g. the style class for EmailForm section could be `footer-EmailForm`.
